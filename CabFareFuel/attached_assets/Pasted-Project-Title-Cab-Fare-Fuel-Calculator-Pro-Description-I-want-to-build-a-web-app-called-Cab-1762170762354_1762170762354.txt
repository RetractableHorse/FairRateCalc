Project Title: Cab Fare & Fuel Calculator Pro

Description:
I want to build a web app called “Cab Fare Calculator Pro” that lets me calculate detailed ride fares, estimate fuel costs, and send receipts through Square.

Features:

1. Fare Input Fields
   • Base Fare (default $7)
   • Cost per Mile
   • Cost per Minute
   • Trip Distance (in miles)
   • Trip Duration (in minutes)
   • Fuel Type selector (Gasoline, Hybrid, EV)
   • Average MPG (or kWh/mile for EV)
   • Gas Price input (manual or fetched from API)
   • Optional fuel surcharge (flat or per-mile)
   • Dropdown to select fare model (Balanced, Premium, Budget)

2. Fare Calculation Formula
   baseTotal = baseFare + (distance * costPerMile) + (minutes * costPerMinute)
   fuelCost = (distance / mpg) * gasPrice
   if (fuelSurchargeType == "flat") baseTotal += fuelSurcharge
   if (fuelSurchargeType == "perMile") baseTotal += distance * surchargeRate
   totalFare = baseTotal + fuelCost
   Display subtotal, fuel cost, and total clearly.

3. Fuel Price Calculator
   • Manual input or automatic lookup via API (EIA or GasBuddy)
   • Toggle for “Use live fuel data” on/off
   • Show current fuel price, estimated fuel cost per trip, and per-mile cost

4. Square Integration
   • Integrate with Square API to:
       – Accept card payments for calculated fare totals
       – Generate and email itemized receipts to riders
       – Store transactions with date/time, trip details, and fare breakdown
   • Use Square sandbox mode for testing, allow API key config later

5. Itemized Receipt Display
   Example:
   ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ Cab Fare Receipt         │
   ├──────────────────────────┤
   │ Base Fare:          $7.00│
   │ Distance (8 mi):   $16.00│
   │ Time (20 min):      $7.00│
   │ Fuel Surcharge:     $2.00│
   │ Fuel Cost:          $3.60│
   │──────────────────────────│
   │ TOTAL:              $35.60│
   └──────────────────────────┘
   • Option to export to PDF or email after payment

6. UI / UX
   • Clean, single-page design using React + TailwindCSS
   • Mobile-friendly layout
   • Save last-used values in localStorage
   • “Quick Presets” button for different fare zones (NYC, Westchester, etc.)

7. Tech Stack
   • Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
   • Backend: Node.js / Express (for API calls and Square integration)
   • APIs:
       – Gas price API (EIA or GasBuddy)
       – Square Payments + Receipts API

8. Optional Extras
   • Export ride history to CSV
   • Chart comparing fare models
   • Dark mode toggle

Goal:
A functional prototype that can run locally or on Replit, showing working fare and fuel cost calculations, with placeholders for future live gas and Square API integrations.
